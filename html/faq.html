            <ul>
                <li>Why do your demos on your Games page have no graphics?</li>
                <p>
                    As an organization soft crash does not have artists, we create tools <br>
                    so that those in our parent company can give them to artists to create tools. <br>
                    So our tech demo's are more proof of concept since we don't employ any artists.
                </p>
                <li>Why do you have no major releases like any other game studio?</li>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in question 1 we were never meant to get a following, so we<br>
                    have only made systems for others to implement.
                </p>
                <li>I want to support you, how can I?</li>
                <p>
                    Buy games that use our technology, so really any RPGs made by EA, so we can keep <br>
                    funding our tool creation.
                </p>
                <li>So are you ever going to release a game?</li>
                <p>
                    A year ago we would have said no, but out engineers have spent so much time <br>
                    developing these tools that we feel we're ready to transition into a small team. <br>
                    Our Games page has a small demo on the dialogue system we have developed for the now named <br>
                    Bartender 2088. Other systems are in development, and we have the blessing of our parent company,
                    so wish us luck as we begin 2013!
